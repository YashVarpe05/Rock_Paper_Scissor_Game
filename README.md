## Rules

- Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
- Agree ahead of time whether you’ll count off “rock, paper, scissors, shoot” or just “rock, paper, scissors.”
- Use rock, paper, scissors to settle minor decisions or simply play to pass the time

# Determine the winner.

- After you’ve both played an object, look to see who’s won.
- Each object wins against one shape and loses to another. For instance, rock “crushes” scissors but is “covered” by paper, paper “covers” rock but is “cut” by scissors, and scissors is “crushed” by rock but “cuts” paper.
- The player who picks the stronger of the two objects is the winner.
- If both players throw the same object, it’s a tie. In this situation, simply play again.
- Continue doing this until there is a clear winner.
- Many people choose to do “best of 3” or “best of 5” since rock paper scissors is such a quick and easy game to play.
- If you play with more than 2 players, continue playing rounds until there’s one player left standing.
